# 🚆 Java Railway Ticket Booking System

A **console-based Railway Ticket Booking System** written in **Java** that allows users to **book**, **cancel**, and **view ticket availability** for different berth types (Lower, Middle, Upper), along with RAC and Waiting List management. The system handles berth allocation dynamically and maintains user data for efficient booking and cancellation.
